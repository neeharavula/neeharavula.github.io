                <div class="title-caption">
                    <h2 class="appear">Overview</h2>
                    <p class="appear">In my <strong>User Experience for Interactive Media (CMPM 131)</strong> class at UCSC, I worked in a team of five to design a music producing platform called <strong>Melodics</strong> that allows artists to create and share their work
                        with friends. Much of the music producing software and applications available today often have overwhelming interfaces and are very complicated to use, which can be discouraging for aspiring producers seeking to start their music
                        journey. Additionally, experienced music producers have limited avenues to safely share their music in production stages and obtain valuable feedback from friends and other musicians. We wanted to address these problems by creating
                        an application that</p>
                    <li class="appear">Lowers <strong>barriers to entry</strong> for beginners, and</li>
                    <li class="appear">Reduces <strong>frustration</strong> with the music-making process</li>
                </div>

                <div class="title-caption">
                    <h2 class="appear">Research & Insights</h2>
                    <p class="appear">To better understand how to help both beginner and experienced music producers, we surveyed people from different backgrounds and asked questions centered around emotions:</p>
                    <!-- INSERT BUBBLES HERE -->
                    <div class="bubble-container appear">
                        <div class="bubble">
                            <p class="bubble-text">What do you feel during your process of making music?
                            </p>

                        <div class="bubble">

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Our survey yielded the following insights:</p>
                    <li class="appear">Most people who haven't produced music before did so due to a <strong>lack of ability</strong> or trust in their ability to learn</li>
                    <li class="appear">People lacked the <strong>motivation and time</strong> to learn complicated music production tools</li>
                    <li class="appear">Some experienced producers didn't want to feel like they were working when making music; they wanted it to remain an <strong>enjoyable and creative pursuit</strong></li>
                    <p class="appear">From these findings, we were able to establish a goal for <strong>Melodics</strong>: to foster a fun, motivational, and collaborative environment for new and seasoned music producers alike. It would function as a social media website
                        that allows users to not only publish songs in-progress, but also publish them as a collection of individual audio tracks. From there, other users can give feedback by commenting on tracks or communicate with friends privately
                        through direct messages, and ultimately make the production learning process less of a solo journey for those who seek guidance and community. </p>

                <div class="title-caption">
                    <h2 class="appear">Design & Usability Testing</h2>
                    <p class="appear">To accomplish our goals, we started by creating <strong>user personas</strong> that represent the sentiments of the people we surveyed and <strong>user journey maps</strong> to determine the best possible flow and navigation of the
                        application that meets all requirements. From there, we created a <strong>user flow diagram</strong> that encompasses all of the possible actions the user can take, from creating an account to revising a music stem based on feedback
                        received from other users.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../assets/melodics/userflow.png" alt="user flow diagram" class="user-flow appear">
                    <p class="appear">From there, we began our prototyping process by sketching out key frames onto paper, determining color, font, and organizational schemes that best adhered to our goals, and finally turning them into fully-functional, interactive prototypes
                        with <strong>Figma</strong>, ready for usability testing.</p>
                    <p class="appear">[ insert pictures of sketch and final prototypes ]</p>
                    <p class="appear">We had three participants from varying experience-levels with music production test our high-fidelity prototype. Overall, our styles, color scheme, and design choices generated positive reactions from our participants. However, they
                        sought a better overall cohesion of details (icons and color uses) and more interaction, especially with our chat system and our mascot, Mozart the frog. We further improved our prototype based on this feedback until we achieved
                        a final design that satisfied our goals and requirements. Some of these improvements included creating additional frames/pages relevant to collaboration (friend suggestions, user profiles, etc.), redesigning our mascot to provide
                        usage tips and enhance users' experience, and adjusting our fonts and icons to be more consistent and pleasing to the eye.</p>

                    <p class="appear">Throughout our development of <strong>Melodics</strong>, we learned a lot about the problems we were trying to address and the intended audience who faces them. The biggest next steps for our product (along with most products similar
                        to ours) would be marketing and advertising. Right now, our application is focused on those who want to familiarize themselves with music production and are looking for feedback to improve upon. Marketing our tool towards this
                        group would help us build a dedicated user-base and also allow us to test and identify problems with scaling and real user interaction.</p>
