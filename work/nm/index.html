                        <strong><a href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com/" target="_blank" class="hover-underline-animation">Northwestern Mutual (NM) <span>&#8599;</span></a></strong> &nbsp;is a financial services and life insurance company based in
                        Milwaukee, WI. I spent the summer working on a <strong>client communications</strong> team within NM's <strong>Engineering Solutions Delivery</strong> division, which is responsible for modernizing the development and delivery
                        of communications and applications used by over 10,000 field representatives. These client communications can consist of physical contracts, statements, bills, and correspondence, as well as digital notifications sent via text or email.

                    <h2 class="appear">Contributions</h2>
                    <p class="appear">To create and deliver a new letter or communication, my team worked through a <strong>letter onboarding process</strong> with the following steps:
                        <li class="appear">Gather the client data (policy account numbers, address, billing info, etc.) needed to create the specific communication</li>
                        <li class="appear">Check if the communication must be sent digitally or physically via mail</li>
                        <li class="appear">Check if there are multiple pages/documents for the communication, and if so, bundle them together</li>
                        <li class="appear">Store communication bundle(s) in digital or physical storage</li>
                        <li class="appear">Deliver the communication based on the client's preferences</li>
                    </p><br>
                    <h3 class="appear">Task 1: RMD Notification (Pre-Existing Communication)</h3>
                    <p class="appear">I had the opportunity to get involved with this process with the development of an existing email notification for <strong>Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)</strong>, a communication that specifies the minimum amounts that US tax
                        law requires someone to withdraw annually from a traditional IRA or employee-based retirement account. This is an example of a common type of communication that gets sent out to field representatives about their clients and the
                        policies they signed up for.
                    </p>
                    <p class="appear">I was responsible for modifying the <strong>JavaScript</strong> code to update the data and structure of this notification according to new product requirements (ex: ensure that the client information table in the email is populated
                        with the correct data, produce an excel attachment for the table data if it exceeded a certain length, etc.). I also performed <strong>end-to-end testing</strong> using <strong>Postman API</strong> and <strong>AWS DynamoDB</strong> to ensure that the email notification was successfully able to pass through each step of the aforementioned letter onboarding process and updated as expected upon final delivery.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3 class="appear">Task 2: Prospect Registration Letter (Brand New Communication)</h3>
                    <p class="appear">Towards the end of my internship, I also had the opportunity to work on creating and onboarding a brand new marketing communication, a <strong>Prospect Registration Letter</strong>, designed for prospective clients who don't yet own
                        any NM products or policies. This involved creating a new client communication definition, which serves as the recipe containing the steps needed to create this document, determine what data is needed for it, determine how it gets
                        delivered, etc. before it is submitted to the letter onboarding process.
                    </p><br>
                    <h3 class="appear">Task 3: Software Vulnerability Remediation</h3>
                    <p class="appear">I was also able to engage in software vulnerability management. <strong>Vulnerabilities</strong> are potential security exposures in a piece of software or application that can cause issues if left unaddressed. I was involved in the process of identifying
                        and remediating 12 vulnerabilities that were affecting some of the code in our department using <strong>Grafana's Vulnerability Dashboard</strong>, before those code changes were deployed to production.

                    <h2 class="appear">Reflections</h2>
                    <p class="appear">Throughout the summer I had the opportunity to work with software and applications I wasn't familiar with before, including MySQL Workbench, Postman, and AWS DynamoDB, and was able to work with and learn from professionals
                        from teams both inside and outside my department which really helped me expand my technical skills and open my eyes to all that the fintech world has to offer. Overall, my summer at NM was an incredible experience— I learned so
                        much working at the intersection of finance and technology, met so many amazing people, and had a great time exploring Milwaukee!
