                    <h2 class="appear">Overview</h2>
                    <p class="appear"><strong><a href="https://www.ga.com/" target="_blank" class="hover-underline-animation">General Atomics <span>&#8599;</span></a></strong> &nbsp;is a global defense company with several affiliate divisions including <strong>Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI)</strong>                        and <strong>Electromagnetic Systems (GA-EMS)</strong>. I spent the summer working as a Software Developer Intern on a <strong>Modeling and
                        Simulation</strong> team under GA-ASI's <strong>Autonomy and AI</strong> department, which is responsible for the delivery of military-grade <strong>unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)</strong> ground station flight simulation software.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- TASK -->
                <div class="title-caption">
                    <h2 class="appear">Task</h2>
                    <p class="appear">My team utilized an application called <strong>AVSim</strong>, which simulates the flight of UAVs including real-time aircraft telemetry data. AVSim can communicate the simulated telemetry data via <strong>UDP messaging</strong> to
                        other applications such as a 3D virtual world simulator app or to a physical ground station computer itself to see the aircraft in flight.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="appear">One fallback of AVSim, however, was that it did not offer a way to visually see the data it was sending out to other apps/computers. Therefore, my task was to develop a <strong>monitor</strong> application that could be used in conjunction
                        with AVSim to allow developers or ground station pilots to easily examine the telemetry messages being generated by AVSim. This would help users quickly identify errors in the data that might be affecting the behavior of the aircraft
                        during flight and ensure that the right data is being passed to the apps/ground station as needed.</p>

                <div class="title-caption">
                    <h2 class="appear">Process</h2>
                    <p class="appear">To accomplish this task, I worked through the <strong>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</strong> which involved the following:</p>
                    <li class="appear">Establishing technical and functional requirements</li>
                    <li class="appear">Identifying potential use cases and error-handling based on <strong>Interface Control Documentation (ICDs)</strong></li>
                    <li class="appear">Creating wireframes/mockups of the monitor graphical user interface (GUI) and making modifications according to feedback from design reviews until achieving a final design that satisfied the established requirements and use cases</li>
                    <li class="appear">Performing iterative development in <strong>Python</strong>, beginning back-end with the implementation of a <strong>multi-threaded UDP client-server program</strong>, and then moving towards front-end with the construction of a
                        <strong>graphical user interface (GUI)</strong> using Python's <strong>Tkinter</strong> toolkit</li>
                    <li class="appear">Testing with my own test client (which contained a simple, parsable telemetry message that mimicked an AVSim message) and with AVSim itself, and making modifications as needed until the expected behavior was achieved</li>
                </div>
                <!-- REFLECTIONS -->
                <div class="title-caption">
                    <h2 class="appear">Reflections</h2>
                    <p class="appear">During this internship I encountered a lot of 'firsts' that helped me grow immensely in both the technical and professional domains. Coming from primarily back-end experience, this was my first time working full-stack and I found that
                        I really enjoy the front-end and UI/UX design phases of the SDLC along with the back-end development phase. It was also my first time implementing a multi-threaded client-server program. While intimidating at first, I was able
                        to achieve the desired functionality by using an iterative/incremental approach to development:
                    </p>
                    <li class="appear">I first started with a basic client and server that could communicate over a UDP sockets</li>
                    <li class="appear">Then in my client module, I implemented a message class object, where class members represented aircraft telemetry data fields (ex: altitude, pitch, etc.) similar to the structure of AVSim's messages, and ensured that my server was
                        able to receive and parse the message data as required</li>
                    <li class="appear">Finally, I added threading functionality to my server in order to be able to process and display multiple message types from AVSim on my GUI at a time</li>
                    <p class="appear">This was also my first time working within a <strong>collaborative scrum environment</strong>, where I learned how to break down my project into more manageable chunks, communicate my progress and issues effectively, and work through
                        sprint cycles efficiently. Overall, it was an incredibly rewarding experience that allowed me to apply <strong>object-oriented design</strong> and <strong>systems programming</strong> concepts I learned in school to building a
                        real-world application, and helped me gain more confidence as an aspiring software developer!</p>
